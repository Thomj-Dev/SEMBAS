# SEMBAS
State space Exploration using Boundary Adherence Strategies (SEMBAS) is a technique for finding phase transitions in performance for a search space. The boundary between performance modes can provide useful insight into the characteristics of the system. For example, if the target performance mode is "Safety" (which may be defined by your specific use case) the boundary between safe and unsafe behavior can provide meaningful test cases, whereas the extremes (highly safe and unsafe) may provide no insight at all. Furthermore, these boundaries may be used to analyze probability of performance modes be sampled from (executed by the function under test.)
