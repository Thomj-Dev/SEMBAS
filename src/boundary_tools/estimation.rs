/// ## Error (Err)
/// * SamplingError : If the sample is out of bounds or the boundary is lost, this
///   error can be returned. BLEs can sometimes be remedied by decreasing @hs's
///   distance from the boundary. Out of Bounds errors are due to limitations of the
///   input domain, so reducing @d's size can circumvent these issues.
